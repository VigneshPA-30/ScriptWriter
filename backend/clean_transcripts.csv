" This man turned our favorite childhood drink into a 470 CR rupee empire. N Kaker, a former Coca-Cola executive, used to carry homemade aam panna to his office. It was so good that his American colleagues couldn't get enough of it. This is when it struck him, ""Why not commercialize this beloved traditional drink?"" So, in 2013, N started Paper Boat with just two drinks: aam panna and jaljeera. But back then, the top shelves of retailers were dominated by giants like Coca-Cola and Pepsi, so how could a drink like aam panna compete? It was then that N and his team decided to create a brand that wasn't just about taste, but also about childhood memories, because these traditional drinks have been part of the childhood of every Indian millennial. Paper Boat's content showcased nostalgic moments, like sitting on a briefcase trunk at a railway platform or the excitement of the first day of school. Today, Paper Boat sells in seven countries and achieved the impressive sales of 474 CR rupees in 2023 alone.

"This man got frustrated with Ola and Uber, so he built his own taxi company. Theas Barda, founder of Schauer, is building a luxury taxi cab startup in the city of Bangalore. Frustrated with the terrible experience of a normal taxi, he decided to build one of his own. The idea was simple: making a taxi cab that he would want his friends and family to travel in. So in 2022, he embarked on the challenge to build a gold standard of rides.

Schauer started by fixing the basic experience that one would expect while riding in a taxi: professional driver, in-car entertainment, freedom of choosing air conditioning, and water bottles and chocolates for their customers. These are things that are super basic, but how many times have you gotten all of these while riding in a cab? This proved to be a big differentiator for Schauer, and did I mention they only provide EV cabs? Strong fundamentals gave Schauer its edge, and because of this, they have created a raging cab service in just 2 years. Watch the full video here to understand how Schauer is cracking down the taxi industry.

"This man's single experiment led him to conquer 42% of the market share. Launched in 2001, Bajaj Pulser was an experiment of Rajiv Bajaj. During those days, there were no smartphones and no social media. The only marketing channels that were available to Rajiv were newspapers and billboards. So how did Rajiv manage to sell 1.2K pulses in the last 20 years? The answer is a simple play on the prize and positioning of the bike. See, back then, Royal Enfield had already started targeting the macho man category. Rajiv saw whitespace here and started targeting the young, college-going boys. This worked, and Bajaj Pulser became an irresistible bike for any young man. But he realized that for college students, money will be a big problem, and here he came with a genius strategy of providing bike loans and EMIs through Bajaj Finance. Through this, Rajiv created a beautiful loop for selling his bikes. Even today, about 50,000 pulsers are sold every single month. No wonder Pulser has 42% of the market share.

"This man defeated a monopoly and created a $1.2 billion company: Dashan Patel, The Man Behind Move and Dermol, was tinkering to create a new product. Soon, he launched his own company, Vinnie Cosmetics, and came across a simple problem. He realized that Indians don't care about the quality of perfume; they just want more sprays in the bottle. He came up with a product that minimized waste and prevented the liquid from vaporizing: Fogg. Fogg was revolutionary in nature as it was the first liquid based deodorant and had 800+ sprays per bottle. But Fogg had to take on the giant, Axe, which had 30% monopoly over the market. Competitive pricing and heavy marketing helped Fogg get 7% market share. Seeing Fogg's rise, Axe started fighting back, but the final nail in Axe's coffin came when Fogg created one of the most iconic lines in advertisement history: ""Uncle, Fogg."" In less than a decade since its launch, Fogg became the leader in deodorant market of India.

He started Phool as a small startup, but it turned into a million-dollar company within six months. Now, how did it do that? See, believe it or not, they ditched farms and used Temple flowers at dirt cheap prices. They then use these flowers to manufacture incense sticks and sold them at a premium. See, Phool realized that they will never be able to compete with local incense stick makers, so they played a different game. They decided to position themselves in a premium gifting category and prize themselves perfectly to ensure maximum profits. Smart positioning and grabbing the white space has made Phool a multi-million dollar company today, and that's how.

"This man opened a restaurant with only 20 seats, but it makes 9 in revenue. Kav Kapa decided to open Naru Noodle Bar in 2022 after seeing a lag of authentic rahen restaurants in Bangalore. Today, it is one of the most sought-after restaurant experiences for any rahen enthusiast. But what made Naru Noodle Bar so successful? See, apart from providing a great experience, Naru Noodle Bar ensured to limit its supply of customers. I mean, the restaurant only has 20 seats and provides three slots that one can book for dinner and lunch, meaning it can only [serve] 120 customers a day. This means the restaurant has no walk-ins, and the only way you can book a seat at the restaurant is on Monday at 8:00 p.m. through online booking. This exclusive way of booking creates a sense of curiosity and also the fear of missing out, ensuring a 90% fill rate to what they can serve every day. This is completely opposite of how the restaurant industry operates, where they try to fill in as many customers as possible, but for Naru Noodle Bar, it has worked like a charm.

"This man failed 20 times before he built a 500K dry fruits empire. Vikas Nahar, born in Kartica, hailed from a family of farmers that farmed coffee and pepper. Seeing his family in business, Vikas always aspired to start his own venture. He tried 20 times and failed 20 times, but never lost hope. In 2016, an idea struck him: he saw a massive white space in the healthy snacks category with the idea of providing nutrient-dense food and building on what our moms have always been saying for ages, ""Beta, badam khao!"" He launched Happo with just 10,000 rupees in hand, but there was a major problem. Tell me, when was the last time you remember buying dry fruits from a brand? Vikas realized that if Happo failed to solve this problem, people will forget about the brand. So, Happo played on the premium packaging so that the product stood out on the store shelf. This worked beautifully as Happo scaled from 10,000 to rupees 500 in just 8 years.

"You have to remember that back in the day, like when we started, which is 10 years ago, there was no healthy packaged food in India. Anandita and me had spent some time in—we used to go to the viam yoga, yoga class, and when we used to come out, we used to go to TJ Joe and take a Kind bar. We used to eat in a Kind bar, and every time we used to eat, we'd be like, ""Why do we not get these things in India, right?"" So, we saw these products in the US. We realized India doesn't have any of them. So, my sister came back. The minute she came up with the name Yaba, we trademarked it. We started the company two years later. But the early proof was we used to sell in a couple of yoga studios. So, I used to go to 1,000 yoga at that point in time. After the yoga classes [were] over, I would cheaply remove all these bars from my bag. I would keep it at the—the receptionist used to sit.

"This man makes 1.2 monthly from a simple Indian snack: samosas. Amit Naran, along with Disha Pand, started the Samosa Party back in 2017. Realizing that samosa is part of every Indian household event, Amit and Disha thought of a way to turn the highly unorganized samosa and Indian snack space into a branded Empire. So how did they do this? They spent 1 and 1/2 years experimenting with different flavors like Karahi paneer and chicken keema to their samosas, and innovated samosas with 46% fewer calories by using less oil than their street versions. This smart approach struck a balance between catering to health conscious Urban consumers while delivering on the flavor. These samosas become a massive hit with the urban crowd because of their taste and convenience. Because of this, Samosa Party went from selling just 200 samosas a day in 2017 to serving over 355,000 samosas daily across 50 locations in just 6 years.

"The economics of a dine-out restaurant versus a cloud kitchen: we ordered two pizzas to the studio today. Now, for a dine-out restaurant, this would mean 25 to 28% will go to food cost, 5 to 7% on packaging, 15 to 20% on labor (considering kitchen plus service stuff), 10 to 15% on rentals, and around 5% goes for miscellaneous costs. Now, we got this via Swiggy, so a commission of about 20%. This means they get up to a gross margin of about 5 to 10%.

Now, for a cloud kitchen, the food cost is similar, so around 25 to 28%. Packaging increases a little bit, so gets to 7 to 10%. Labor cost is lower, so a solid 10%. Rental is lower, so about 8 to 10%, and a Swiggy commission of 20%. So, this gives them a gross margin of about 30%.

Now, for a 100 rupee pizza, the dine-out restaurant makes 10 to 15 bucks, whereas a cloud kitchen makes nearly 30 bucks.

"This guy made a 600 CR company just because he couldn't focus on fitness in college. Rishu Satya realized that majority of Indians are heavily nutrient deficient, and while there were many nutrition brands, most of them focused on protein. Rishu saw the gap and started building Plix, the plant fix, which offered plant-based wellness products. It worked like a charm. Plix achieved 10 CR in its very first year, but in order to scale, Rishu needed a like-minded partner, and he found just that in founder of Oziva, Akash Zaveri. Oziva merged with Plix, and together they added 85 new products to their portfolio, achieving a revenue of 106 CR last year. Their massive success did not go unnoticed, as FMCG giant Marico bought a 58% stake in Plix for 369 CR.

"This man got bored of his office coffee, so he built a multi-car coffee startup. After he shifted to Bombay, Arman Sud got his first taste of office coffee, and it was not a pleasant experience. Arman saw major two problems in the Indian coffee space: one, that most brands were using Robusta and not the specialty coffee beans like Arabica; and second, that making a good cup of coffee was a tedious process. He sought to solve this problem and looked back at his childhood. He noticed that he grew up drinking cold coffee. NES Cafe made it popular for all the '90s kids. That is when it struck him, and he started tinkering with cold brew. Now, cold brew was not something Arman invented, but just like Nescafe, he made a cold brew easily accessible and convenient to make. So Arman started Sleepy Owl, launching cold brew with innovative packaging. You could just put a bag in the water, put it in the fridge overnight, and enjoy a freshly brewed cup of premium 100% Arabica coffee without putting in any work. Today, Sleepy Owl is worth in crores and has a variety of coffee products that caters to thousands of people.

It all started in 2016 when Mukesh Bansal acquired Cult and merged it with Curefit to form Cult.fit, a one-stop solution for all fitness-related needs. They wanted Cult centers to be not more than 20 minutes away from their customers. That's why many initial acquisitions were of fitness centers like 1000 Yoga, Trive Fitness, and Fitness First. With this, they got the insane scale of 160 Cult.fit centers, 140 Gold's Gyms, and 40 fitness centers spread across 32+ cities. This is where they're playing a game that was never played by anyone before. See, Cult aims to be a fitness platform and not a fitness chain, so it emphasizes acquiring any brands that will cater to their customers' needs. In doing so, they have created a catalog of products like Cult Sport for equipment, Eat.fit for healthy food, and Mind.fit for mental health. You get the gist: becoming a one-stop solution for any fitness enthusiast.

Shast, after settling debts worth almost $2 billion in the U.S., founded Freed in 2020 with the aim of creating a debt-free future for Indians. At the end of 2022, Indian banks had 93,000 CR of stressed unsecured loans. This is not surprising, because over 70% of iPhones are bought on EMI, and every three in four products on Amazon sale is bought on EMIs. Clearly, Indians are using unsecured credit to fuel their aspirations. The problem occurs when the person who has taken this loan is not able to return the money, creating a bad debt for the company. Freed comes in here by providing debt consolidation services that solve debt settlement.

"[Music] This man is behind your favorite childhood drink and a 3000 crore brand. The story goes back to when a 13-year-old Aris Kata was selling soda water on bullock carts, where he realized that there was no refreshing drink for kids of his age. With the idea of having a healthy drink for kids, Rasna was born in 1979. See, Rasna was always advertised as a healthy drink for kids, with no added sugar, which actually saved them 60% cost on sugar. But Kata knew that Rasna had to become a household name, and the legendary campaign, ""I love you Rasna,"" was born. With the success of the campaign, Rasna had acquired 75% monopoly on the market. But soon the giant came knocking. Coca-Cola launched Sunfill to challenge Rasna's throne. Rasna held their ground by launching modern flavors like watermelon and pineapple, which appealed to kids. Coca-Cola accepted defeat and withdrew Sunfill within just 2 years of its launch. Today, Rasna is the world's largest soft drink concentrate manufacturer.

"You probably don't know this, but India has 2.6K baby birds every year. But in 2023, less than 6% of Indian parents bought diapers. This is very surprising, but what's the reason behind India's terrible diaper market? See, diapers aren't a need, but a want. With most Indian parents, it becomes sort of a need only when the kid is going outdoors. On average, the cost of diapers for 2 years is 26,000 rupees. No wonder the demand isn't as big as it should be. But there is one company that just might change the whole game of the diaper market: Bumbum. Founded in 2011, Bumbum saw a trend that parents are willing to spend on luxury they couldn't afford as kids. They targeted tier 2 and tier 3 city audiences and priced their diapers at the lowest cost in the market. By selling a premium product at an affordable price, Bumbum is on a path of monumental success.

MAA, after suffering through obesity for almost the entirety of his life, researched deeply to crack the ultimate fun of nutrition so that he doesn't gain weight anymore. In doing so, he realized that most food brands gave only half the truth about their products. Frustrated, he decided to open The Whole Truth in 2019. The idea was simple: be a 100% transparent brand that has zero artificial sweeteners, preservatives, and sugars. In fact, in the initial days, third-party manufacturers even rejected them, as their bar recipe literally had no binder or sugar liquids. So, these manufacturers wanted them to change their recipe to fit their machines. But Shang was keen on using only six healthy ingredients, so he chose to manufacture his protein bars in-house instead of relying on a third-party manufacturer. This came at an added cost, but it paid off massively in creating trust with their consumers. But there is more truth to The Whole Truth story. Click the link below to know more.

Matt Chitranjan had shifted back to India in 2011 for his job after struggling to find a good cup of specialty coffee and taking a bet on the growing Indian consumption of coffee. Matt left his job and opened Blue Tokai along with his wife, Namata. With humble beginnings, the couple started with a small roster at their home, but what gave Blue Tokai an edge was the insane knowledge that Matt had about coffee. See, while most FMCG giants and Starbucks deal in commodity coffee because they are cheaper to produce, Blue Tokai focused on specialty coffee beans like pure Arabica, which are considered the most superior beans with the best flavor profile. And they did this by taking advantage of the fact that India is the eighth biggest producer of coffee, but sadly, most of it is exported as there is a lack of demand. Blue Tokai came in between and offered the farmers not just better rates than traders but also recognition on every single packet. But there is more to Blue Tokai's story.

"This man built a $274 business selling silver jewelry. In 2019, Ishra Agarwal, an IIT graduate, founded Ja, which is India's fastest-growing e-commerce brand specializing in silver jewelry.

Back in 2019, India's jewelry market was dominated by gold brands like Tanishq and Kalyan Jewellers, while the silver market was dominated by small, unorganized tiers who offered inconsistent quality. So, Ishra saw an opportunity to bring trust and quality to the silver jewelry segment.

But why did Ja choose silver as its core focus? See, earlier, the majority of women used to be homemakers and opted for heavy gold jewelry when attending family weddings to showcase their family status. But the number of working women has grown significantly over the past 20 years, and they now prefer minimalist, lightweight jewelry for a clean, sophisticated office look. Ja capitalized on this trend by offering elegant silver jewelry designed for modern, style-conscious women. This helped Ja to carve a niche and become a leader in the silver jewelry market.

The first step was extensive subsidies by the government to both consumers and automakers. For context, this is something India started only in 2015. Second, it nailed range anxiety with electric vehicles by solving charging infrastructure, and perhaps the most important one was vertical integration.

While his vada pav business was thriving, he noticed that a local burger shop near his Vashi store was also attracting a lot of customers. And even though Jumbo King was also selling burgers along with vada pav, customers came to Jumbo King primarily for vada pav and went to that local shop for burgers.

And these same customers associated the local burger shop with aspirational and premium price point of 140 to 150 rupees. So, he repositioned Jumbo King as a brand that sells only burgers and dropped vada pav from its menu entirely and made the brand an instant hit.

He basically said that unless you have a lot of food options or a large menu to offer, it's completely okay to have one food item in the name of your brand, and that's because your user can at least expect one food item that you will be the best at, and that will be your foot into the door with that user.

After repeated failures in competitive exams, he and his school friends started a tea shop in Indor in 2016. But how can you turn a 6 rupee chai, which is given free in most offices, into a 150 business? They realized that in India, chai is often consumed with snacks, so they adopted a smart menu strategy where they paired the low-cost chai as a hook product with a high-margin item in the combos. For example, pairing tea with a simple snack like Samosa boosts the average order value, increasing the margin way higher from just a 6 rupee tea. By strategically pairing snacks with tea, they also boost the perceived value of each order, making the combos feel like more food for a slightly higher price. Today, they serve over 3 lakh cups of chai daily and have created jobs for over 500 people from economically weaker communities. Guess the Brand and name them in the comment section!

We started looking; analysis, data, insights came out there that a large chunk of teenagers were buying iPhones just around their farewell parties, and the moment the farewell would get over, the iPhone would get returned, because on the night of the farewell party, I have to show my iPhone around, I have to click pictures, and next day, like I didn't touch it. And there are other categories of people who would just replace, because that time the logistics and Flipkart deliveries used to be like on the weight basis, so they would carefully choose a mango to be the same weight as the iPhone 7 so, so that they can replace it in the box and send it. I mean, that's where we started doing those delivery checks, and now open box delivery has come for a reason. But yes, iPhone is the perfect guinea pig for all frauds in the country.

"This woman loved lipsticks so much that she built a 420 lipstick company. Coming from a small district called Anand in Gujarat, Vinita Singh turned down a job offer to launch Sugar Cosmetics in 2015. She came across a simple problem: she realized that existing international brands like Maybelline and L'Oreal were not suitable for Indian skins, as their products were developed according to global skin standards. These international brands overlooked India's high pollution levels and humidity compared to the West. So Vinita realized that Indian millennial women needed long lasting makeup that could withstand India's heat and pollution. This led to launching a matte range product specifically designed for Indian skin tones. These products suited the Indian skin tone and were more durable. This became a massive hit in India, and today Sugar Cosmetics is available in 50,000 retail outlets in India and has a massive valuation of 4,000.

"I mean, nothing against the banks or the lenders. I believe the entire lending institution has been created to keep people in debt. If there's no debt, they will not make money. 37, 36% transactors who are paying balance in full, you have almost 30, 32% of people who are converting it into… we all would have experienced, you swipe a card for a certain amount and you get an SMS from the bank immediately, “You can convert this into an EMI.” Why is that being offered? If I can transact, if I can fully pay, why am I being offered an EMI? Because that EMI is not interest free. That is coming at a 12%, 18%, whatever it is, right? And if I skip one EMI, or if I'm delayed one EMI, guess what's happening to that balance? That entire thing gets rolled into a 48% APR.

"Hostels have always existed, but to brand it, to do it in offbeat places in India, how did the idea of Zostel even come about? I graduated from IIT BHU, and my co-founder, DV D Singh Chauhan, we both are batchmates. We were very fascinated by the concept of interning abroad, so DV went to Germany, and I went to UK. There, we backpacked. From there, we understood the value of community. So there's a concept of Gap year. People take that Gap year to travel, to explore what they want to do. We were backpacking and we met lot of people from all the countries and all those things, and that really opened up our mind. It felt like we were living in a cocoon, although we were from IIT and all those things were there. Backpacking in Europe, meeting with different people, interacting with people who do not understand your language, and still interacting with them, partying with them, making friends - that was something that really touched both of us. DV, he was very confident that I want to build this traveling culture. It was not like we want to build hostels. We want to build this traveling culture. We want our youth to travel and experience what we have experienced.

"RBI might have just stopped PM lending dreams. Let me explain. Recently, RBI, the Godfather of Indian fintech startups, decided to increase risk weight to 125%. This impacts you, me, and all the fintech companies giving out loans. But how?

For that, first we need to understand what risk rate means. Imagine HDFC giving out a rupee 100 loan. Out of this loan, rupee 8 needs to come from HDFC's capital. Rest, 92, can come from people like you and me who have deposits with HDFC.

With 125% risk rate, banks will now have to put rupee 10 for every 100 rupee lent. Paytm, which is neither a bank nor an NBFC, has a lending partner who gives out loans, and Paytm pockets 2 to 5% commission on that loan amount.

Higher risk rate will mean Paytm's lending partners will now need a lot more of their own capital to lend out the same amount of loan, which results in Paytm netting reduced commission. Paytm's only solution in the short term is to focus on merchant loans, as they have much lower default rates and lower risk than a retail customer of Paytm.

"17 or 18, we did our first, like, April Fool's fake product launch. Now it's very common. Now every brand on April Fools does a fake product launch. But it was this year, a day or two before April Fools, we did a celebrity doppelganger campaign where we actually, while surfing Instagram and stuff, found doppelgangers of Amitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan, and Shah Rukh Khan. So we wrote to those doppelgangers, and we said, ""Listen, we're going to send you our product. Depending on whatever the fee, can you take a photo with the product and using the product?"" So, so they did. They took the photos, they sent it to, and then we made like these sample holdings of, uh, the celebrity saying, with a caption and a comment and a small asterisks saying T.K.H., right, sole with a doer of Salman Khan. So it didn't, never said Salman Khan. Then there was asterisks saying refers to pares, who was the actual guy. Same for Aman, it was Amit G. Dig S in asterisks. There are, you know, 1 million people in named Am.

"What is the name of your startup? It's Super B. Du, describe what does your startup do in one sentence? We are the Canva for homes, empowering any person on the planet to design their dream home effortlessly. What's the problem that you are trying to solve? People struggle with visualization. Second thing is, there's always this tug of war between design aspiration and budget limitation. Finally, the existing 3D tools are very complicated, so we're trying to solve those problems. Tell me your craziest startup story. We grew 47x last year, and we haven't spent a penny on marketing. How big is the marketing opportunity? If I take the global interior design market, it's about $250 billion. India is about a $30 million opportunity. What was your worst pitch moment? Oh, there was a moment where the project took eight and a half minutes to load when we were giving a demo to a large builder. That guy, like, said, ""This is not going to work,"" and then we bounced back from there, and today it loads in a snap. One suggestion for an early stage founder: talk to your customers, build something which is valuable to the person who you're building for, and they should brag about it. Thank you so much. A yes.

"This man went from rupees 1 lakh in bad debts to building India's biggest slipper Empire. Ramesh Kumar Dua grew up seeing his father's struggle to manage his two businesses of footwear and cycle parts. Seeing his father's struggles, 17-year-old Ramesh dropped out of his medical exam to join his father's business. Ramesh rented out his family property and used the 10,000 rupees he got from the tenants as the capital for his brand. These 10,000 rupees gave birth to the brand everyone knows as Relaxo. Ramesh was so obsessed with making the ultimate product that he studied everything about rubber. His studies bore fruit, and that's how the iconic Hawai chappal was created. But just when everything seemed going right, India was hit with emergency. See, the footwear sector was reserved for small-scale manufacturers only, so Ramesh set up different units under Relaxo to continue his business. Even the giant B trembled from the growth of Relaxo. There onwards, today Relaxo makes 2,800 in revenue and sells 18 CR slippers annually.

"Zepto became the first unicorn of 2023. That is why this is important because of the prevailing economic and geopolitical fragility India is facing a long winter in the venture capital investments. But Zepto did something unthinkable. With over 200 million dollars raised in the recent funding, that now valued at 1.4 billion dollars, is thriving while other companies are struggling. Becoming a unicorn in just over two years is massive, and Zepto's extreme operational discipline and tech infra made this happen. See, they realized rapid delivery leads to a decrease in cost rather than an increase in costs. Zepto stores, called Dark stores, have optimized this to a point where the order is packed and ready to be delivered in just 76 seconds of it being placed. This helps them to maximize order quantity with fixed labor and rent costs and achieve the quickest delivery time compared to their competitors. This bar-raising efficiency helps Zepto achieve this monumental achievement. For more insights like this, subscribe to GrowthX.

"This man went from shutting down his company to building the first unicorn of India. Navin Tiari, along with his friends, launched mKhoj in 2007, which focused on SMS search and monetization. But, even after raising $500,000, they were struggling to make any mark because of the limiting and asynchronous nature of text messages, which were not exciting enough. Navin stayed resilient and noticed a great opportunity. He realized that more people were switching from personal computers to mobile devices and decided to quickly pivot to mobile advertising services, took a gamble on the future of the mobile industry, and it massively paid off. With a newly rebranded company called InMobi, Navin and his team laid a trail-blazing path for building a $15 billion company.

"Just made a personal investment of rupees 100 crore in Nazara Technologies. Following that, SBI Mutual Fund agreed to invest rupees 400 crore in Nazara Tech to private placement. But why are these Financial Giants investing in a gaming company? See, Nazara Tech started in the early stages of internet, and it was one of the first entrants in the Indian market in Esports and Cricket simulation. And with the success of some of its mobile games, it has built a solid foundation in the gaming industry. Also, Nazara has some pretty solid products like Kidopia, which is a gamified early learning segment. But the real gold mine is Nazara's Esports and real money game segment. Their products, like Norwin, gaming experience strong growth, which increased their operational revenue from rupees 130 crores rupees 223 crores in just one year.

"Here is what Paytm can learn from Indigo. Last year, Indigo made rupees 762 just by selling food and beverages. They made a 70% margin on the food business. This number is important because this is the same game Paytm is playing. Let me explain you Paytm's path to profitability. See, Paytm makes very little revenue from its UPI transactions, even though the volume of transactions has grown over the years. Paytm realizes this, and the real bet they're taking is making money on its lending and payment gateway business. They made rupees 12,200 from payment services in quarter 3 alone this year, which netted them rupees 459 crore in margins. This is absolutely amazing, given this vertical being extremely new for Paytm. Offering credit with RuPay cards on Paytm is the next step that they will take for capturing margins through its lending and payment gateway business, and probably in the next four years, these two will contribute to more than 50% of Paytm's net profits.

"He started this hostel. Now, how does the split happen, and what does the number look like? If he has 40 beds and we have an ARR of 1500, 40 into 1500 would be 60,000. Average Zostel's occupancy is more than 70%, and in Mumbai, this case is 90%. This guy is earning 50,000 every day. 30% of it he earns from FNB. Like, 50,000, if he's earning from that, 15,000 more he's earning from FNB, so he's earning in the range of 65-70,000 per day. So, 70,000 into 30, if you will do it, will come out to 21 lakhs. And Opex cost is 30% of the overall rate. If 21 lakhs, if you do 30%, then it would come out to 6-7 lakhs, and we take 21% on the overall revenue, that is Zostel's commission, and 15% on FNB. He's earning almost 10 to 12 lakhs per month in total, and he has invested, as I told you, 1.2-1.3 CR. So 10 to 12 lakhs, if you, 10 months, payback period is 10 to 12 months. If you don't have your own property, then payback would be more because you have to give rentals. And if you have your own property, then nothing like it.

"This man failed 20 times and didn't even go to a college, and now he makes rupees 150 selling coffee. Anarak Chabra faced constant rejection at job interviews because he did not have a college degree. Frustrated, he decided to start his own business. While doing market research, he came across the concept of instant coffee cubes, which were already popular in the US. Inspired by this, he decided to bring the idea to India, but with a twist. He realized that with India's rising disposable income, people loved cafe-style drinks, but visiting cafes everyday was expensive and inconvenient. So he launched Bezilla with coffee cubes, which were formulated to mimic cafe-style flavors such as vanilla, hazelnut, and Irish cream. At his, but most coffee drinkers in India are loyal to brands like Nescafe and Bru, and they rarely switch to new brands. To counter this, Ana positioned the product as an on-the-go alternative for modern consumers, as the coffee cubes eliminate the need to worry about water-to-coffee ratios or brewing time, and they get the same taste every time.
